Changes since the last version
------------------------------

The newest version, including changes since the last release, can be obtained using ``git checkout master``.

.. Right now, there are no changes beyond the last release.
   Maybe there are some feature branches waiting to be explored.

- feature to calculate the covariance matrix of the resulting spectral function in Gaussian approximation


Version 0.9, 2018-08-24
-----------------------

This version can be obtained using ``git checkout 0.9``, as there is a tag called ``0.9``.
It has been checked to work with the following TRIQS hashes:

- TRIQS 1.4.x, hash `816aff2882e581b7fe0ae071842b53fc27d31346 <https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/tree/816aff2882e581b7fe0ae071842b53fc27d31346>`_
- TRIQS 2.0.x, hash `dc2cbc572478bcd5c35ba4777f6bbdeacd3f2262 <https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/tree/dc2cbc572478bcd5c35ba4777f6bbdeacd3f2262>`_

but it probably also works with other commits.


This is the initial version that was published.

It includes (among other features)

- analytic continuation with a :math:`G(\tau)` kernel,
- the Bryan and MaxEnt cost function,
- entropies for diagonal and off-diagonal elements,
- elementwise and poor man's matrix MaxEnt,
- several analyzers for determining :math:`\alpha`,
- the sigma continuator,
- tools for getting :math:`G(\omega)`,
- plotting h5 files, and
- preblur.
